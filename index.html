                <br>
                <h2>Lee Jong-suk</h2>
                <br>
                <p> Lee Jong-suk (Korean: 이종석, born 14 September 1989) is a South Korean actor and model.
                    He debuted in 2005 as a runway model, becoming the youngest male model ever to participate in Seoul
                    Fashion Week.
                    Lee's breakout role was in School 2013 (2012).
                    <br><br>
                    He is also well known for his roles in I Can Hear Your Voice (2013), Doctor Stranger (2014),
                    Pinocchio (2014), W (2016), While You Were Sleeping (2017), The Hymn of Death (2018) and Romance Is
                    a Bonus Book (2019).
                    <br><br>
                    Lee began his mandatory military service on 8 March 2019. Lee was deemed unfit to enlist as an
                    active duty soldier as a result of going through a car accident when he was 16 and tore his anterior
                    cruciate ligament. Therefore, he was confirmed to work as a public service officer, and was expected
                    to be discharged on 31 December 2020. He was finally discharged on 2 January 2021.
